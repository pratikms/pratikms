### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Engineer who loves solving real world problems. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Go, Python, JavaScript (NodeJS) and PHP. 

I love what I do, and am constantly honing my craft. I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others as publicly as possible. You can follow along with me, I try to document my journey the best I can by writing articles. 

If you found value in something I have created, please feel free to give me a shout out [@pmshivaraikar](https://twitter.com/pmshivaraikar) or give some â™¥ on [mail](mailto:contact@pratikms.com).
